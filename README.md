# Pennsylvania Counties US Census Data Project
This repository is a data analysis project using US Census Data from every county in Pennsylvania. 

Please visit the Pennsylvania Counties US Census Data Cleaning notebook to view the full data cleaning process. 

I added a FIPS county code column to the dataset for each county in Pennsylvania. FIPS is a five-digit Federal Information Processing Standards code which uniquely identifies counties in the United States. We can use FIPS county codes along with geojson to create Plotly Choropleth Maps.

The following sections of the dataset have been prepared for data analysis:

- Employment Status

- Population 16 years and over

- Households with children

- Commuting to work

- Occupation

- Industry

- Class of worker

- Income and benefits

- Total households

- Families

- Nonfamily Households

- Health Insurance Coverage

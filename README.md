# Pennsylvania Counties US Census Data Project
This repository is a data analysis project using US Census Data from every county in Pennsylvania. 

Please visit the Pennsylvania Counties US Census Data Cleaning notebook to view the full data cleaning process. 

I added a FIPS county code column to the dataset for each county in Pennsylvania. FIPS is a five-digit Federal Information Processing Standards code which uniquely identifies counties in the United States. We can use FIPS county codes along with geojson to create Plotly Choropleth Maps.
